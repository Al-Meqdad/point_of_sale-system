# Point Of Sale System

This is a really simple React application of a POS.

to get started all you have to do is :
 - git clone https://github.com/Al-Meqdad/point_of_sale-system.git
 - npm install
 - npm start

The application is targeting helping users buy items through a separate caching screen without relying on the cachier everytime.
Once you start the application you will see how simple and straight forward it is, I tried to implement the most known and simplest designs
such as the McDonalds buying screen to make it fairly simple and easy for everyone to understand and have no difficulty using it.

Currently the application is built in an Admin state where you can edit, add, and delete most of the things you can see in the webpage, but hopefully will try to 
update it more in the future by adding login/signup with authentication and JWT.
## Code

The code might be a bit complex and messed up, but I tried my best to use the best practices and to lessen the complexity of the code,
I know it's not perfect but i'm happy with what I achived and I will keep on learning.

You can find 2 Codes in my project if you looked at the commits, JSX version and TSX version, as I refactored the whole code into Typescript after I finished the minimal
implementation of the application, you can check both by:
- for JSX: git checkout JSX
- for TSX: git checkout TSX
